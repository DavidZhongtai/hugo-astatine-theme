Run the following inside your Hugo site folder:

```
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/hugcis/hugo-astatine-theme
```

You can now build your 

## Configuration

Take a look at the sample
[config.toml](https://github.com/hugcis/hugo-astatine-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml)
file located in the
[exampleSite](https://github.com/hugcis/hugo-astatine-theme/blob/master/exampleSite)
folder. It has some documentation for the available fields.

## Content Types

### Main page

![Screenshot of the main page of the example
site.](images/screenshot.png)

This is the main page of your site. You can find the source that generated the
page at
[content/_index.md](https://github.com/hugcis/hugo-astatine-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/content/_index.md)
. It contains three components: an info box with your profile picture and basic
information (this is populated with the front matter of the `_index.md`), the
content of the page (this is the markdown body of `_index.md`), and a list of
publications (also controlled by the front matter of `_index.md`).

### Posts

Used for blog posts. Blog posts are listed on the posts page.

Run `hugo new post/<post-name>.md` to create a post. The `Posts` section is
there by default, but you can change this in the configuration file (see
[config.toml](https://github.com/hugcis/hugo-astatine-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml)
).

## Syntax highlighting

Astatine is using [Chroma](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) and `pygmentsStyle = "native"` by default. If you would like to use another style you have to adjust the colors in `pre` in main.css.
